# Conditional Statements with `if...else` in Python

![if_else](/img/if_else.png)

In Python, the `if...else` statement is a fundamental construct that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on a specified condition. This construct is a natural extension of the basic if statement, which allows you to execute code if a condition is true. However, with the `if...else` statement, you can specify code to execute if the condition is false.

Here's a simple example:

    x = 10

    if x > 5:
        print("x is greater than 5")
    else:
        print("x is less than or equal to 5")

In this example, we've defined a variable x with the value 10. We then use an `if...else` statement to check whether x is greater than 5. If the condition is true, the code inside the `if` block is executed, which prints the string "x is greater than 5".

If the condition in the if statement is false, the code inside the `else` block is executed, which prints the string "x is less than or equal to 5".

With these basic concepts in mind, you're ready to start using conditional statements with `if...else` in Python! And as you grow more experienced, you'll discover many more advanced features and techniques that make conditional statements an indispensable tool for writing high-quality, maintainable code.
