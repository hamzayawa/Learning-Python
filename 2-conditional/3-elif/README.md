# Conditional Statements with `elif` in Python

![elif](/img/elif.jpeg)

In Python, the `elif` statement is used to create more complex conditional statements. It's a shortened form of `else if,` and it allows you to chain multiple conditions together to create more nuanced branching logic.

Here's an example:

    x = 10

    if x > 10:
        print("x is greater than 10")
    elif x == 10:
        print("x is equal to 10")
    else:
        print("x is less than 10")


In this example, we've defined a variable x with the value 10. We then use an if statement to check whether x is greater than 10. If the condition is true, the code inside the if block is executed, which prints the string "x is greater than 10".


If the condition in the if statement is false, the program moves on to the elif block. The elif block checks whether x is equal to 10. If that condition is true, the code inside the elif block is executed, which prints the string "x is equal to 10".

If both the if and elif conditions are false, the program moves on to the else block, which is executed if none of the previous conditions are true. In this case, the else block prints the string "x is less than 10".

With these basic concepts in mind, you're ready to start using conditional statements with `elif` in Python! And as you grow more experienced, you'll discover many more advanced features and techniques that make conditional statements an indispensable tool for writing high-quality, maintainable code.
